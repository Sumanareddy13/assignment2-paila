### Basketball
**Raise the ring in victory! Bring On The Swish! One more attempt! Put the haters to rest!**

Everyone has their tastes and preferences.This statement applies for sports too."Basketball" is my favorite sport which I learned in my highschoo.The game was also invented in a college.I love this game because of its intensity where we do not have stops in the game and also the ball-handling skills.It also develops self-discipline and concentration.<br>**We will learn teamwork, although team work applies for every sport this game builds mutual trust and friendhip among team mates.**
